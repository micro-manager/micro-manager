This directory contains an extremely bare-bones example library. If you want to
build this library, you will need to rename the file "rename-to-build.xml" to
"build.xml" (without the quotation marks) first, and add "ExampleLibrary.jar"
to the nobase_mmlibrary_DATA section of the Makefile.am file (which is in the
parent directory to this file).
