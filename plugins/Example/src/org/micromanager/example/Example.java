/**
 * A very simple Micro-Manager plugin
 * 
 * This plugin does nothing, its sole function is to make it easier for developers
 * to start writing Micro-Manager plugins.
 * 
 * Copy this code to a location of your choice, change the name of the project
 * (and the classes), build the jar file and copy it to the mmplugins folder
 * in your Micro-Manager directory.
 * 
 * Once you have it loaded and running, you can attach the NetBean debugger
 * and use all of NetBean's functionality to debug your code.  If you make a 
 * generally useful plugin, please do not hesitate to send a copy to
 * info@micro-managaer.org for inclusion in the Micro-Manager source code 
 * repository.
