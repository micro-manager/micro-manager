; Overall scheme
; the GUI is generally reactive.
; vars:
; memory-tiles (indices -> pixels)
; disk-tile-index (set of tile indices)
; display-tiles (indices -> pixels)
; view-state
;
; Whenever an image is acquired, it is processed, mipmapped and each
; resulting tiles are added to memory-tiles-atom. Tiles
; added are automatically asynchronously saved to disk, and the indices
; are added to disk-tiles.
; memory-tiles and display-tiles-atom are limited to 200 images each,
; using an LRU eviction policy.
; When view-state viewing area is adjusted, tiles needed for the
; new viewing area are loaded back into memory-tiles. If we are
; in explore mode, then images not available in memory-tiles or
; disk tiles are acquired according to the spiral trajectory.
; Overlay tiles are generated whenever memory tiles are added
; or the contrast is changed.
; The view redraws tiles inside viewing area whenever view-state
; has been adjusted or a new image appears in display-tiles-atom.
