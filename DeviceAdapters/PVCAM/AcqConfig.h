/**
* This class holds the camera and acquisition configuration. The idea is that
* if user changes a property during live mode the configuration is stored in
* "future" configuration class. Once the live mode is restarted the "future"
* configuration is compared to "current" configuration and the camera, buffers
* and other acquisition variables are set accordingly.
* This approach resolves the problem that comes from how MM handles property
* changes during live mode:
* 1) The OnProperty() handler is called
* 2) StopSequenceAcquisition() is called
* 3) StartSequenceAcquisition() is called
* Because the OnProperty() is called during live acquisition some intermediate
* variables cannot be updated right away - for example binning or ROI because
* these are still used in ongoing acquisition. Instead, we need to remeber the
* "new" or "future" state that must be applied once StartSequenceAcquisition()
* is called.
* Previously we had many variables like: newColorMode, currentColorMode, newBinning,
* currentBinning, etc. These are, or should be all transferred to this class.
