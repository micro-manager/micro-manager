 * This class provides access to the shutter controls, allowing you to

 * access this class via Studio.shutter() or Studio.getShutterManager().
 * It largely shadows methods in MMCore (like setShutterOpen() or
 * getAutoShutter()), but it is recommended that callers use these methods
 * instead to ensure that all shutter-related GUI objects remain up-to-date,
 * as it also posts events that notify GUI elements when the shutter state
 * changes (see ShutterEvent and AutoShutterEvent).
