/**
 * This interface defines the metadata for Images. Note that Metadatas are 
 * immutable; if you need to modify one, create a new one using a 
 * MetadataBuilder.
 * All fields of the Metadata that are not explicitly initialized will default
 * to null.
 * You are not expected to implement this interface; it is here to describe how
 * you can interact with Metadata created by Micro-Manager itself. If you need
 * to get a MetadataBuilder, call the getMetadataBuilder() method of the
 * DataManager class, or use the copy() method of an existing Metadata.
 *
 * This class uses a Builder pattern. Please see
 * https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Using_Builders
