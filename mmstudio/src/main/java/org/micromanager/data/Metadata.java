/**
 * This interface defines the metadata for Images. Note that Metadatas are immutable; if you need to
 * modify one, create a new one using a MetadataBuilder. All fields of the Metadata that are not
 * explicitly initialized will default to null. You are not expected to implement this interface; it
 * is here to describe how you can interact with Metadata created by Micro-Manager itself. If you
 * need to get a MetadataBuilder, call the getMetadataBuilder() method of the DataManager class, or
 * use the copy() method of an existing Metadata.
 *
 * <p>This class uses a Builder pattern. Please see https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Using_Builders
