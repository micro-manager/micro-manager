 * fields of the SummaryMetadata that are not explicitly initialized will
 * default to null. You are not expected to implement this interface; it is here
 * to describe how you can interact with SummaryMetadata created by
 * Micro-Manager itself. If you need to create a new SummaryMetadata, either use
 * the getSummaryMetadataBuilder() method of the DataManager class, or call the
 * copy() method of an existing SummaryMetadata instance.
 *
 * This class uses a Builder pattern. Please see
 * https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Using_Builders
