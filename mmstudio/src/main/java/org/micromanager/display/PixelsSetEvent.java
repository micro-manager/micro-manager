/**
 * This event is fired immediately after the image data displayed by the
 * DisplayWindow is updated. Listen for it if you have a control that displays
 * information pertinent to the currently-displayed image. This event fires
 * in the main update loop, and thus it is safe to update GUI components from
 * it -- but on the flipside that means that doing anything time-consuming in
 * response to this event is a bad idea because you'll slow down the GUI.
 * Also note that this event can fire multiple times for the same image, due
 * to requests to the display to refresh the image display.
 * Third-party code is not expected to produce this event.
