/**
 * Event used internally by a data viewer to respond to requests to update the display settings.
 *
 * <p>All compliant {@code DataViewer} implementations post an instance of this event when told to
 * change the display settings (this is usually handled by {@code AbstractDataViewer}).
 * Implementations then subscribe to this event, and in their handler(s) arrange to apply the new
 * settings.
 *
 * <p>{@code DataViewer.setDisplaySettings} and other methods that can result in new display
 * settings can be called on any thread. This event is posted from any such calling thread. Thus,
 * handlers for this event must be prepared to be called on any thread, including the Swing/AWT
 * event dispatch thread (EDT).
 *
 * <p>It is guaranteed that only a single instance of this event will ever be posted concurrently
 * for a given data viewer, and that such posting will happen in the correct order.
 *
 * <p>Although applying display settings almost always requires interaction with UI components,
 * handlers for this event must not perform any action synchronously on the EDT (such as by calling
 * {@code SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait}). Instead, actions on the EDT should be deferred until a
 * later time (such as by calling {@code SwingUtilities.invokeLater}).
 *
 * <p>This event may be posted at a relatively high frequency (up to 60 times per second under
 * normal conditions, though there is no guaranteed upper limit), so well-designed handlers should
 * defer time-consuming operations to a later time.
 *
 * <p>It is okay for objects not directly related to the data viewer to subscribe to this event, but
 * they must obey the same rules regarding threading and performance.
