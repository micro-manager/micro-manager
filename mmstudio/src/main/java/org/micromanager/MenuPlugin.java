 * A MenuPlugin is a plugin that should appear under the "Plugins" menu.

 * - All ProcessorPlugins appear under the "On-The-Fly Image Processing"
 *   submenu of the Plugins menu (and, when selected, will bring up the
 *   Image Processing Pipeline window).
 * - All OverlayPlugins appear in the Inspector frame's "Overlays" section.
 * Currently, adding plugins to menus other than the Plugins menu is not
 * supported.
