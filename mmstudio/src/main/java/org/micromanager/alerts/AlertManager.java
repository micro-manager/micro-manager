   * Send notification of a specific event. Events are grouped by both title and group (the group is
   * not directly exposed to the user in the GUI), and only the most recent event for a given
   * title/group pair is normally shown to the user. This can thus be useful for notifying the user
   * of events that you anticipate may occur many times (for example, errors in processing images
   * due to a malconfigured processor). If the group is null, then the alert will always be shown,
   * in addition to all other alerts for this title.
   *
   * <p>If the user dismisses one of these alerts, they are effectively clearing the "message
   * history" for the alert. Future calls to this method will create a new alert rather than
   * resurrect the old one.

   * @param group Object to use for grouping multiple alert texts together. May be null; null-group
   *     alerts are always displayed.

   * @return Either a newly-created Alert, or the Alert that already existed, to which this new
   *     alert text was added.

   * repeatedly can rapidly fill the window with alerts.

   * of the alert (via UpdatableAlert.setText()). While this does not directly affect the display of
   * the alert in the Messages window (the caller is of course responsible for that), it does affect
