/**
 * UpdatableAlerts are Alerts whose message texts can be changed after they have been posted. They
 * are intended to be used to provide ongoing information about some changing event. For example,
 * the "images received" tracker that runs during an acquisition is a UpdatableAlert.
 * UpdatableAlerts may be created via AlertManager.postUpdatableAlert(). This class type is also
 * used for custom alerts created via AlertManager.postCustomAlert().

   * will also update the text in the alert in the Messages window. Note that this method is only
   * appropriate for alerts that show the current status of something (like the acquisition status
   * alert). Usually you should use a combining text alert rather than update this text directly.
