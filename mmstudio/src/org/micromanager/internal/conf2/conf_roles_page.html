   <h2>Default Device Roles</h2> 
       <ul>
           <li>Micro-Manager treats one camera, shutter and focus stage as "defaults" for the main control window.</li>
           <li>Here you can choose the defaults for Micro-Manager startup.</li>
           <li>These default roles can be changed at any time while Micro-Manager is running
               through the Device Property Browser (as properties of the Core).</li>
